# Introduction

Dabbu’s APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow you to access your files and folders from any provider (Google Drive, Gmail, Microsoft OneDrive, etc) from a **single, unified interface**. Behind these APIs is a software layer that connects to these providers and returns your files and folders in one unified format.

If you want to use Dabbu to manage your files and folders, go ahead and follow instructions [here](./install).

If you are a developer or just enthusiastic to learn more about how Dabbu works, read on!
